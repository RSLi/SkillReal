# SkillReal
(Still in development)

Here's a general discription of SkillReal:
SkillReal is an android app that serves as a gamification tool that motivates deliberate practice of real life skills.
Users create skills that they want to practice, and upgrade the skill after they've practiced the skills in real life, as simply as clicking the button.
Skills can be grouped into catagories to help record the user's relative time commitment on different "attributes", and help identify what aspects of life can be particularly improved.

The app is still in development and more features will appear later on.
